# SDLGames
All my SDL2 Games

Mostly written in C++

## Installation

1. Clone the repo into a folder

2. Clone the SDL2 repo into a folder within that folder

3. Change the file paths in the makefile to go to that SDL folder

4. You may need to copy SDL2.dll from SDL2/bin into the top level (alongside the executable)

## Execution

Just click on it, I don't know

## Bugs

You shouldn't be running this code anyway
